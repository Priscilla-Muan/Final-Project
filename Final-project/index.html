        <h3>Why is Education Important?</h3><br>
        <p>Even a basic education leads to better pay and a way out of poverty. Educated workers are more efficient at tasks requiring literacy and critical thinking, which increases business productivity and leads to a stronger economy.</p>

            <p>Education makes a difference in communities that are fragile or forced to rebuild and can help with emotional growth, aiding people in overcoming trauma due to entrenched discrimination, conflict, war or natural disasters by providing not only stability but hope. Educating women and girls has particular benefits, such as better jobs, later marriages and fewer children, who are half as likely to suffer from malnutrition or die before the age of five as those with uneducated mothers.</p>
